8529358,23493369,"I've found all the top sizes 2 sizes too small for me, even though I measured myself and looked at their size chart. Tops come down to my belly button, wrists are too tight to get over watches, and zips don't do up as they don't reach across my chest.    I'm 6ft1 slim 75kg and ordered the M-L"
8529358,23211290,I can‚Äôt get enough of Van Rysel product amazing quality and comfort thank you Van Rysel
8529358,23067208,"Loved the jacket, light weight and can easy to store. Used it for both wet weather cycling and running."
8529358,22780033,A great lightweight rain jacket which folds up small. Wind proof and breathable.
8529358,22547032,Need to get 2 bigger sizes up
8529358,21765116,Love this jacket. Fragile though...mind you I did come off at 30kph and it ripped...but bought a new one...nuff said. Mind you packing in pocket is tight...my wife has the knack.
8529358,21443079,good garment. Note this is a race cut so check sizes and don't assume they are the same as earlier purchases. They are not.  Purchased to replace an older version. identical design bar the Van Rysel rather than Btwin logo. But sizing totally different. Large fit now far too snug and compared to the Btwin is a thinner cut on arms and torso yet length identical. Bad idea to change size spec. will be returning the item.
8529358,21339999,Body fits perfectly.   Area around the elbow area is tight

8529358,21300780,"Despite having a function that allows it to be tucked into its pocket, there is no instructions on how to, and does not feel like it can fit into that pocket."
8529358,20316318,"Lovely, lightweight jacket which is both water and windproof. Great fit and looks the part too"
8529358,20230475,"Very disappointing experience with this product. I brought it along with me while I commute to work today and it happened to rain before I alighted the bus. I wore it and even had an umbrella with me, yet I was wet because the wind was blowing the rain onto my body.     I would return the product for a refund if it's allowed."
8529358,20140841,"Lightweight, packs away nicely and does what it says. Brilliant."
8529358,19898911,Happy üòÉ
8529358,19856533,10/10
8529358,19788744,"Great occasionally use showerproof jacket, very packable"
8529358,19139988,"Haven't tried it in the rain yet but so far so good. Very thin, nice colour, good arm lengths, nice little pocket in the back to pack it, contrary to what others are saying, it does pack into the little pocket but you would have to stop riding your bike for 2 minutes to put it in. I bought a L and I am 5'10, 78kg fits me perfectly. I am usually a medium but with all cycling gear I go a size up. So I recommend going a size up at least for this."
8529358,18102594,"A nice fitting smart jacket for light showers. On a recent ride I encountered a shower and am pleased to say the jacket kept me dry. Folds down to the size of a fist so easy to carry, looks smart too."
8529358,17833477,"I really like this jacket. It does keep the worst of a downpour off you, and has great ventilation, and it‚Äôs very light. Best used as an extra layer when it‚Äôs warm and wet out. It is also fairly windproof. My only criticism is the xx size doesn‚Äôt fit easily into its pocket. Maybe if I were an s it would be fine, but it‚Äôs only just too big. Price is fair, and it looks fairly pro."
8529358,17778910,"Used during medium rain for 5 hours, no leaks. Back ventilation allows for good airflow avoiding ""sauna effect"". Packs light and small fits in a jersey pocket and doesn't take much space in my framebag."
8529358,17312786,Comfortable to wear and works as intended. :)
8529358,17195296,Amazing coat and amazing performance.
8529358,16975527,"Nice and compact, but as a slim guy I still needed to go for the next size up when compared to the size guide. The pocket/pouch is way too small to fold the jacket into, so will need to find a separate pouch."
8529358,16670255,light and compact. A product that did the job with affordable price
8529358,16342010,Amazing product and quality
8529358,15832726,Ultra light wind and rain jacket that is durable and easily packs away in your jersey pocket. Great for cool early morning starts or unstable weather days. Great for long treks into the mountains and changing climates.
8529358,15765628,"I would suggest you go a size up when purchasing this item. The pocket is far to SMALL to roll the jacket into. In regards to its actual use, have had it on once when the rain started, but couldn't test it as the rain stopped, kept it on as the weather in Scotland is unpredictable and it kept the wind out."
8529358,15561450,"Great jacket for light drizzle/shower or setting out early morning as an additional layer, easily foldable. It will not protect you against heavy sustained showers though."
8529358,15107608,Good fit but a bit expensive
8529358,14882193,"Fantastic rain jacket that packs down into a cycling jersey back pocket. Excellent quality, breathes and better looking than some of the expensive brands."
8529358,14747940,"bought for summer,good tight fit,lightweight,"
8529358,14446271,Good
8529358,13570132,"Good well made jacket. Go for a size up from what you would normally buy.Ideal for those long rides. Easily fits into your back pocket, keeps the wind out without overheating, fine in a light drizzle but anything heavier than that it does start to seep through, so not quite as waterproof as claimed but overall still a good buy."
8529358,13105294,"this jacket is not even shower proof, even the slightest bit of rain goes through it, my windproof jacket is more waterproof than this.."
8529358,12915046,"It's small and will protect you from the wind, mostly. It is not really waterproof. Not more than any other non-waterproof material really. It does pack very small though, which is nice."
8529358,12300627,"I‚Äôve not tested it in the rain yet, but the jacket fits well and feels really good. But as others have mentioned the stuff sack is pointless - nowhere near big enough, so now I‚Äôll have to get a separate stuff sack. It‚Äôs a shame as it would be perfect otherwise."
8529358,11943698,"I personally like the design, smart black and its light.   I love it! Kudos Decathlon!"
8529358,11911294,"Got useful within the week, when out cycling at Changi Coastal Road one night. Without the jacket, I would have been very cold with the rain and strong wind. Packs very well into small package. Would be even better if it folds into its own pocket."
8529358,11713611,"I love this jacket. It‚Äôs light and fits just right. It does the job in light rain and even in a short downpour. The only thing that lets it down is the pocket size, it‚Äôs simply too hard to get the whole XXL jacket Into it. I had to resort to buying a separate pouch for it."
8397296,23500299,"I ordered this particular down jacket, the Forclaz Men's MT 100 Hooded Down Puffer, after doing much research online. After receiving and wearing it for several week I am very pleased! It so light weight but don't let that full you. The 800 down fill keeps me warm in cold temps. It has become my go to jacket and I look for opportunities to wear it I'm so pleased with the jacket. As others would recommend, I would too. That you order a size up from you normal size. The extra large fits me perfect at about 5'10 185 pounds. If you're looking for a great light weight quality puffer jacket at a very reasonable price, this is it!"
8397296,23477811,"My wife and I and my in-laws all purchased jackets from Decathlon for a Grand Canyon backpacking trip. Did it's job and purchased to leave my more expensive down jackets at home. Performed exceptional for it's price. My MIL fell and tore open her jacket and we were able to patch it up no problem, only losing a few feathers. Wish the zipper was on the right side instead of the left side, but not a deal breaker as I have a few other jackets like that."
8397296,23465804,Not for -5¬∞c temperature
8397296,23364233,At this price I never recommend this. Not warm even in 10'c . Don't go for it. Waste.
8397296,23362083,The garment had lots of long sewing threads present and the badge was sew badly and not straight. Not the manufacturing quality I expect from Decathlon...
8397296,23330900,Awesome
8397296,23286528,Was looking for something cheap and packable to throw in the rucksack for trips. It hits that requirements and more and I have started using it as my daily jacket. May buy a trek 500 and compare for colder weather.
8397296,23276592,"Let‚Äôs be honest, most US residents haven‚Äôt heard of Decathlon. I, myself was one of them but I have been wanting to try a more affordable options out there as most of the ‚Äúname brands‚Äù are ridiculously price out of a lot of consumers price range. I stumbled onto this jacket and was hesitant at first since the price was a lot lower. I was afraid of getting what I paid for, but to my surprise the jacket felt pretty well made and very comfortable to wear. My measurement showed that I should be purchasing a Extra Small, but I went with a Medium and it fits perfectly. This will not be the last Decathlon product that I‚Äôll be purchasing."
8397296,23276529,"I‚Äôm am shocked! I‚Äôve been buying brands like Arc‚Äôteryx, Mountain Hardwear, Marmot, Patagonia for the last 20 years with the odd Columbia, Helly Hensen and north face. Typically i would have had one of this jackets with me but I was on a trip to Halifax and the weather turned out to be much colder than expected. I would not convince to buy myself another high price jacket at MEC. So when we went to Decathlon for other items, I was a bit sceptical when I saw this jacket at such a great price! I tried it in the store and within seconds I could not believe the heat retention. So I thought, heck, at this price, what do I have to lose??? This is one of the Best Buy I‚Äôve done for quality and warmth and definitely THE best by far when it comes to price!"
8397296,23219033,Great jacket
8397296,23090135,Superub
8397296,23088679,I bought this down jacket just over two years ago and it worked fine until the zip broke recently. I contacted customer services as I would expect it to last much longer than 3 years and asked them to repair it or replace it. They told me it is not covered by a warranty and that it was tough luck. I used to think Decathlon had great customer service and they produced high quality goods but not now. I have bought other brands including Rab and Timberland that have last much longer and are still going strong. I will invest in a better quality product in future and avoid this poor quality product.
8397296,23086299,Good product. i am using it in rain and till now it has not betrayed me
8397296,23041266,Very good product
8397296,23016937,Best quality. Suitable for -5 to -8 degree ‚Ä¶ very compact n u can completely fold n wrap in the pocket‚Ä¶
8397296,22995241,"Wondwrful jacket..almost wearing for 2 years. But last sunday i met with an accident on bike while i was wearinv this jacket... so i got a tear on elbow and some dragged scratched on jacket...  So, can it be repaired... please help ?"
8397296,22861479,I love it.
8397296,22829373,"Jacket I got,it from decathlon and this is worst I ever had nothing is in there just plastic  I used this jacket hardly 4 to 5 times and when I start wearing it again so one of my friend told me that they might sent you defective piece he purchased much cheaper jacket then this and thats really warm."
8397296,22822668,The fabric used is of very bad quality.
8397296,22797569,What decathlon mention on product is what it delivers. The jacket is so light and flexible that you will br able to do every activity freely. Its provides greater flexibility to movement and is ready best buy for cold winters
8397296,22758024,Not much warm as expected. Its mentioned that its for upto -5 temperature. But in its ok in above 10 degree.
8397296,22746665,These run small. One size larger was a perfect fit. Eventually I ordered 2 sizes larger so as to accommodate a light base layer underneath. It does that perfectly
8397296,22691979,"This forclaz trek 100 is a wonderful jacket, I questioned the rating but to my special it handles temperatures in the twenties just fine. This jacket is amazing for the price. It's quality is as good if not best than the jackets $100-200 more. Not sure how Decathlon has done it but it seems to me that all the other are way over priced.   If you are looking for a great quality jacket that is warm when you need it and in the $100 dollar price range look to no one else but Decathlon and their Trek 100. You will not be disappointed.   The only gripe I have with the jacket which was my fault, was the size. I had to return the first one due to size. I don't like a tight jacket. But on the positive note, the return/exchange policy from Decathlon was flawless."
8397296,22678471,Was looking for light weight and waterproof jacket. This fulfilled my requirements.
8397296,22664372,I bought this product with the hope that it would support me in extreme cold weather. But I am sorry to say that it is not so soothing at all. It failed to protect windy situations. I bought many products from Decathlon. They are really good. But this particular product disappointed me. I would not recommend it. My money got wasted!
8397296,22621432,Excellent product. Very soft and comfortable. Great quality
8397296,22587631,Good
8397296,22297345,"I have purchased three of these jackets. I purchased one for myself and loved it so much i purchased two more, one for each of my sons as early Christmas pesents. Warmest and most comfortable jacket I own."
8397296,22290697,"The jacket seems well made, but the size guide must be wrong. I compared the size charts for Decathlon men's 3X and another brand (rhymes with ""Coal Cumbria"") women's 3X, and they were the same chest measurements. The Decathlon jacket couldn't even close, much less be zipped up, and was tight in the shoulders, but the other brand was roomy enough for layering a heavy fleece. The other brand costs about twice as much, but that shouldn't effect the size chart accuracy."
8397296,22288771,superb product
8397296,22231841,"I ordered the XL people say this jacket is on the heavy side, but its very light   only issue i had is getting used to the zipper. I do wish there was a inside pocket. I was disappointed by how it came ... it was just tossed in a cardboard box with no bubble wrap or protective bag"
8397296,22225948,Very nice product by decthalon    Loved this.
8397296,22209061,"Don't think about what it's, it's a great price on a great jacket. Example, 38 with 10mph wind in a cotton tee, super comfortable. And I do NOT like being cold. Or even chilly."
8397296,22164033,I purchased the 2XL due to the reviews saying the fit was smaller. The 2XL was much too big and I ordered the XL and it fit much better. I purchased the Decathlon jacket as one to beat up and be able to replace much easier than my Arc Teryx Cerium Down Jacket. I wear an XL Arc Teryx Cerium. It's much warmer. The Decthlon is a great jacket for the cost.
8397296,22154996,"Jacket is without question, excellent for the price. Would love to see drop pockets and cinch cord on the hood, but for the price, it's a perfect no-frills ultralight puffy. I wear a size men's Medium (American here) in everything, so the size Large in this jacket fits perfectly with a mid-weight layer underneath, as well as the ability to add a shell over top without compressing too badly. I'm 6ft and about 170lbs."
8397296,22153830,"I'm 5'9"" and about 145 lbs and generally I find that small size outwear can be too big for me, but extra small stuff is usually too small. For example I just bought a small light puffer from REI that I was absolutely swimming in despite loving the jacket itself.    So... I decided not to size up like everyone recommended and went with the small. I'm very happy I did! I can use this as a fall/spring layer underneath a larger overcoat or raincoat. I probably wouldn't wear it over a thick sweatshirt (too tight), but I can easily wear it over a t-shirt or light sweater. Which is to say, it's a pretty tight fit, but not too tight. I do wish it were a bit looser at the bottom as it kind of rides up my bum. Butt, that's what I was looking for. Something that doesn't leave a ton of extra room.    Other thing that I like ‚Äì¬†the down layer extends over the wrist elastic a bit which is a neat feature.    Hope this helps! Can't speak to the long term durability but overall it seems like a great jacket, particularly for the price."
8397296,22144827,"This is my second Forclaz down jacket. It's a very light jacket but warm enough for all 3 season outdoor adventures. Considering the weight and the 800+ down, you cannot find another jacket at the same price level."
8397296,22139248,"My comment concern more the packaging. Since it is a fragile fabric, I suggest that you should protect it from an aggressive opening of the box (Cutter for example). The jacket was loose in the box and fortunately, I was very careful as opening the box. I could have cut the jacket very easily if not aware!!! Thank you."
8397296,22127810,It Fits me well n it‚Äôs warm ‚Ä¶Very nyc jacketüëåüèº
8397296,22107807,Received the product as displayed. Very good product but the packaging was very ordinary. It's partially damaged at time of delivery. Rest the product was super one..
8397296,22096055,Like it
8397296,22093757,Found from back side tiny portion of cotton came out within usage of three days
8397296,22035665,Great jacket
8397296,22017957,üëçüëç
8397296,22001329,A very lightweight warm down jacket that for the price is a steal. Wore overnight on a camping trip and kept me very warm. It won't be completely waterproof as down jacket are not made to be. But should shrug off a shower or two.
8397296,21950381,Great
8397296,21909623,"No frills down puffy, as advertised. Comments on website said it runs small so I got one size up from my regular size and it‚Äôs a perfect fit. I‚Äôve worn so far as low as 35deg F and it was warm and cozy. Looking to use around town and on winter backpacking trips. Perfect for my needs‚Ä¶and my wallet!"
8397296,21794114,Perfect
8397296,21767256,"Good jacket, greedy Decathlon."
8397296,21560012,"Just tried this today - inside you get very warm in this jacket, outside it was around 18C going down to 11C and it kept me warm with just a tshirt and a mid layer, when static.     It does feel a little thin, I think you should go for the bigger one if you're looking for a winter trekking jacket or combine this with a thicker baselayer and/or jumper as I will. I was looking more for something 3 season for cold days, rather than 4 season for snowy mountains/deep winter!    I am wary though of the claims of -5C, I think you'd be a bit cold with two thin layers and this as claimed - but it's small and packable and really nice. It loses a star because of no drawstring on the hood - they did that on the waist, they could have done it for the hood. Not a biggie but could be a problem in strong winds.    I did buy the 2XL because the XL fitted me perfectly with just those two, but I thought when I add a baselayer and more tshirts it would have gotten a bit Michelin Man, so went 2XL - which means it isn't as affective for me when worn with a few layers but I think it's best to have space to layer up. Also under a waterproof even if the down is compressed I think it would be a lot warmer.    Also I found the cinch for the waistline when I got back, so that will now help keep warmth in more in future. Not sure how the little hook thing that hangs off the toggle works, is that to tidy the drawstring?"
8397296,21461255,"very comfortable, provided adequate warmth and when rolled it takes very little space."
8397296,21129720,Easily one of the best puffy around. As good as many $200 puffy down jackets and maybe even better. Have two of these. Use one on my backpacking and one to my office in winters.
8397296,21079973,"Used in:  Spiti (Himachal Pradesh)    Temp:  0 - 1 degree    Usage:  Used as Third layer (T shirt, Thermals and this, only three layers)    Pros:  - Firstly, one of the best and budget down feather jacket.   - Very light weight, easy to carry.   - Use this over a thermals of decathlon (the 799rs one) and you will be saved in these temperatures.   - Better than large thick jackets which will be very heavy and you will get tired in low temperatures very quickly    Cons:  - Should be very carefully handled against cuts and scratches  - Careful with high temperatures. Exposure to direct sunlight might fade the color"
8397296,21013688,"This has to be my favorite piece of gear out of all my other backpacking gear i own. So light, so soft, so comfortable and warm. The best light down jacket for the money anywhere. I am reg a large and the xl fits nice and snug with a little room."
8397296,20678981,Excellent
8397296,20333917,"The product looks classy and feels really warm but extremely lightweight. But the problem is with the fitting. I have previously bought a padded jacket in size M and so thought that it will be the right size and ordered M. It is even more perplexing to find that in the size chart it is written beside M 37"". Me having a 39"" chest I thought it will be a very tight fit. To my utter surprise, I found out that it is a little oversized for me. What is even more baffling is that the hood actually comes down to my nose, blocking my vision. This is completely unacceptable. Also there is no mechanism to tighten the hood. Disappointed."
8397296,20123756,Nice jacket good fit and compact
8397296,20040127,Works best along with a fleece jacket. Purchase the waterproof variant to account for unseasonal rains.
8397296,19931131,"Please read whole review.  I & my wife ordered exact same model of the jacket. To start with, we were very happy to use the jacket. We wore it outside, and it felt very warm, much better than other or equivalent brands. We were so happy that we decided to use it. We cut all the tag and other things of the product. After a few days, we started seeing small feather like material our shirts after wearing jackets on top of our shirts. We were wondering why our shirts are catching feathers. After careful observation, we found that the small feather like materials are coming out of the jacket. This is insane. I am a big decathlon fan, and I was not expecting this from Decathlon. I even have pictures and videos showing how the feathers come out of the jacket. Unfortunately, we cannot return the products now as we do not have tags. Please think before ordering this.    @decathlon: I know that you ideally sell great products. However, I hope you will test this product more from here on. If possible, can we return the products?"
8397296,19809540,Excellent value
8397296,19796335,"As an avid ultralight hiker i literally spend hours upon hours researching gear and reading and watching reviews. I've had a few ultralight (and some very expensive) puffy jackets and have since settled on this Forclaz one. I can't recommend it enough. Absolute brilliant in every way and at a fraction of the cost of some of the other (¬£200+) big brands versions, of which the Forclaz is comparable. Highly recommended. I'll be getting another when it eventually wears out."
8397296,19789757,Best product
8397296,19604039,"I'm really enjoying this jacket in the early spring in New England (US). My only complaint would be the sizing. I'm usually an L-XL so I typically order an XL to be safe. For this jacket, the XL was a bit snug so I ended up with an XXL (maybe my first). Fortunately, Decathalon was very good about making the exchange."
8397296,19579281,Very well made small details very nicely done and still so well priced
8397296,19546568,feels like good quality fill. outer shell is very soft and the whole jacket compacts down very easily. comfortable to wear and the hood is great.
8397296,19475522,just like all the thru hikers and youtubers tell you. This is one great jacket at a wonderful price.   I think I need to order the TREK 500 so I can go out more in winter.   LOVE IT
8397296,19452512,"Everything is as expected or better. Great, lightweight but warm puffer jacket for literally hundreds less than other brands. Packs up small and is very lightweight and comfortable. Feels premium and looks great with a good fit. Usually I wear mediums; bought a large and it fits perfectly."
8397296,19400577,My husband loves his jacket
8397296,19338948,Good Jacket that keep you warm well enough but not water repellent at all
8397296,19308030,"Looks and feels good quality ,fits nice and it's cheap for what you get !"
8397296,19234314,THIS JACKET WAS REALLY HELPFULL IN SNOW AREA WHERE THE WEATHER WAS AROUND 1 DEGREE TO -2 DEGREES.
8397296,19181112,its super light and comfy. fits great.
8397296,19151688,"Been out with ppl wearing a compact down jacket when the temperature drops, montaine, North Face etc, none of us can fault this jacket for warmth, waterproof it's not! But it's purpose is to keep you warm when it's dry and cold and at a fraction of the price, packs up into its own pocket really small, (you will need to google it), would make a good pillow if you were freestyliing it in a tent or bivvy.  Excellent equipment!!"
8397296,19087844,I had read through dozens of reviews on this particular jacket. I had never purchased anything from Decathlon. I love this lightweight down jacket it packs up into its own pocket and weighs nothing. My brother has since purchased one after trying mine out. Great quality and excellent value for the money. Thank you
8397296,19072199,"Terrific jacket for the price , lightweight and warm , looks good too ....definitely recommend"
8397296,19045081,"I love this jacket. The sleeve cuff is very comfortable. The entire jacket seems to be very well made. Pockets are nice and deep so they keep stuff from falling out even if you don't zip them closed. I'm glad I got the XL and I often wear just a large in t-shirts. I have worn it just commuting to work, but can't wait to test it out camping - there is still a little winter left this year in KY."
8397296,19018756,"Light weight, and warm jacket"
8397296,18948627,"The little jacket that could! Someone recommended this jacket on an outdoor trekking site and I decided to try it! Everyone in my family has one now! Lightweight, well stitched, attractive with a hood, this jacket does wonderful under your pack or just for everyday wear! It packs up into the left pocket into a minimal size for easy storing in your pack when not needed---I just love it! There is a size adjustment at the base of the jacket and the zipper comes all the way up bringing the hood area up around your mouth if you zip it all the way which is nice on cool nights of backpacking--get it--well worth it."
8397296,18885170,"This is the second Country walking magazine Best Buy that I have purchased and I have not been disappointed. The jacket is iight weight, compact yet incredibly cosy and I wear it for most outdoor activities I thought that not having a drawstring around the hood was a disadvantage but it is such a good fit it doesn‚Äôt need one This jacket is extremely good value for money but you must be careful as I don‚Äôt think it is particularly thornproof"
8397296,18830146,A must for winter and hiking trips
8397296,18810028,"I love this jacket. It is super lightweight, warm and very comfortable. I wouldn't wear it in a downpour unless I also wore a waterproof over it. However, it seems to resist light drizzle."
8397296,18737691,"After wearing thermal, fleece tshirt & down feather jacket, at 7 degree Celsius. the jacket hasn't stopped cold"
8397296,18737205,Good
8397296,18700766,Very good jacket
8397296,18686650,I bought the jacket as i wanted a mid layer in a moss / dark green colour based upon its reviews. It was well made and the size guide was spot on .  My Issue was that there was hardly any down in the arms and would never have been warm at +5 let alone -5 . The 800 fill can be misleading as i have a Rab 800 fill down which has loads more down in the baffles and whilst it was 2.5 times the cost they both are said to be 800 fill and something can only be good value if it works.  All jackets should state the amount / weight of the down in a given size and not fool people with down's fill which only tells of how quickly the down lofts after being compressed and the odd feather here of there won't loft or keep you warm.  Maybe i just had a faulty jacket or maybe people are fooling themselves by the price .
8397296,18684433,loved the product. very light
8397296,18656129,"Excellent, go for it"
8397296,18645217,"This Jacket has some great points to it, including the build quality and weight. As others have commented, it is pretty small for the size; I ordered one in the size of clothing I typically wear and what typically doesn't feel tight on me, only to find this jacket is very tight on me, almost to the point that I couldn't zip it. I guess it's just another good reason for me to continue my journey in losing weight. I would recommend you go up a size if possible, and if you are a 2xl (the top size avaialble), you should consider if this will work for you."
8397296,18633162,Very effective in cold weather.Light weight and compact.
8397296,18622711,Good product
8397296,18579310,Good warmth. Works in cold weather. over all good but   1. Head cap is very large and keeps your ears uncovered . No lace ro tie   2. Not much protective from wind  3. Feather coming out through stitch
8397296,18577629,Using it in Srinagar and it is very effective
8397296,18566810,Very warm and perfect looking
8397296,18555390,"Comfort, excellent one"
8397296,18536222,I will always like to buy a jacket from your shop
8397296,18535358,Simple sober AND nice product by Decathlon
8397296,18517831,"Writing this review after a months use.     I used this product in sub zero temperature, it simply is worth every penny you spend. Its is feather weight and warm, though with layers."
8397296,18512058,"I have Patagonia nano puff and Mountain hardware ghost shadow jackets. So far, I like the FORCLAZ TREK 100 best for 3 reasons. 1) it fits best. slightly snaggy fit makes it warmer and looking good; 2) very light for the warmth it has to offer; 3) unbeatable price which is only a fraction of what I paid for other two brands. Hence, I highly recommend this jacket."
8397296,18498485,And you guys advertising for -5 c.
8397296,18495670,Once I wear it the body temperature automatically chage you feel very warn in -2 to -5 temperature..
8397296,18459470,i got this jacket for christmas the only issus with is that it had a broken thred on it it should be ok but the quality could be a bit better. its compact and warm. its nice to wear on brisk days and fits very well i am normally a large size but got a 2xl as there sizes are not the same as the stuff you buy in the stores. so is this worth buying yes! if there is anything wrong with it i highly suggest you send it back.
8397296,18448644,Very good quality
8397296,18448174,"Bought this a few days ago as there was a cold wave where I stay, at Almora and Kausani - where the night temperatures are in the near zero.     However the jacket seems to be less effective as the temperature goes below the 10s. I found that it was effective after adding 3 inner layers - a themal, a thick full sleeve fleece, a hoodie and the jacket on top. With this much layering, this jacket can be replaced by another fleece instead and should be enough - especially compared to the price differential.    If you are purchasing this based on the temperature rating only, I would recommend go for something that is supposed to protect you in the negative -10/-15 from Decathlon, in the hopes that it will help you in the closer to zero temperatures. But that would increase your budget."
8397296,18423177,I'm 5ft11 athletic build and I like to be able to layer with my jackets. I took a chance and went with size 3xl as I know this product runs small. Upon receiving it as a Christmas gift to myself I couldn't be happier! Quality and warmth is excellent for the price and I haven't found a down jacket that is close. As far a durability time will tell but I'm very pleased so far.
8397296,18420673,"I purchased this jacket based on the favourable reviews and have definitely made the right choice. The jacket looks good, is very warm, extremely packable and fits really well. I have worn the jacket during a cold snap with a base and mid layer and it did the job perfectly. I am 6ft 2 and generally have issues with the sleeves and body of jackets being a bit small but this fits perfectly. I think that this jacket is superb and great value for money."
8397296,18375660,"Last minute purchase when I realized I didn't have a coat for my return trip to MN after spending 7 weeks in FL. Product arrived earlier than promised. The sizing guide says sizes run small and that is absolutely true. I'm 6 feet tall, 195 lbs and would normally wear XL. I got an XXL based on the recommendation and that was perfect. Jacket is very soft and comfortable and has kept me warm in temperatures to the high teens."
8397296,18371394,Not very warm even in 7 degrees with layers. Quality also ok ok‚Ä¶
8397296,18371347,Not worth the price.. not very warm even in 7 degrees
8397296,18352875,Excellent quality
8397296,18332663,"I ordered a size medium. Very slim cut. If you have even a little ‚Äúexcess padding‚Äù, it seems you would need to size up. My college wrestler nephew (5‚Äô5‚Äù, 135#) was in the right place at the right time and this nice jacket went to him."
8397296,18320034,Very good
8397296,18319827,It's totally ‚ù£Ô∏è
8397296,18308499,Feel comfortable after wear
8397296,18266158,Wait-less amazing product. Thanks decathlon!
8397296,18249271,Comfortable and warm
8397296,18237413,Satisfied
8397296,18226182,The jacket is light weight like wind shield but once you wear it you can feel the temperature difference in your body
8397296,18222228,I love your dawn jackets .only problem is that your dawn jacket contains hoodies which is not detachable. Please use detachable hoodies
8397296,18185748,The best product i can say least
8397296,18157237,I found this jacket to be great fit and style but average in terms of warmth...definitely need a good base layer for Canadian cool weather.   You would need to size up 1 as sizing fits smaller.
8397296,18149466,"Realy superb. I recommend, go for this without any hezitation, without further loss of time"
8397296,18135130,Best jacket but size is big
8397296,18100164,"Tested it till 1 degree celsius and worked like a charm, washing it is a pain, feathers get accumulated at one spot."
8397296,18096258,Very nice product
8397296,18087730,Very good
8397296,18032949,"Though I do love this jacket and it's my main go too now, it does seem to hemorrhage feathers, I hope it'll last me for at least 2 seasons. Other than that it so comfy and warm."
8397296,18028980,This jacket kept me warm in Norway. Loved it. Highly recommended!
8397296,18022433,"Very lightweight but very warm. Kept me warm even when it was -1 watching my son play football. Great value too, had more expensive brands for a lot more money that weren't as good."
8397296,18015233,Great Product
8397296,17970774,Nice product
8397296,17958451,"At $80(cheaper during sale), you cannot find a better warmth:price jacket. Nonetheless, 23F is not feasible unless you are quite active, layer up, and/or zero wind. I live in Chicago and I was uncomfortable cold while walking in 37F at 14mph wind and no layering. YMMV"
8397296,17953650,out of the box feathers already coming out
8397296,17951065,Its light weight and I am fully satisfied.
8397296,17788476,Asked just 5 minutes after ordering if I could change the color to green and they told me I wasn‚Äôt able to alter an order after placing it. It‚Äôs too bad because I don‚Äôt really like the grape-ish purple blue color but I love the jacket.
8397296,17759285,Good product
8397296,17758710,"No air passes away on it, my first ride on this winter season than I am so happy for this forclaz jacket"
8397296,17755618,"I am 5'10 / 190 and originally ordered an XL and it was too small. I think they sent a UK size XL. I returned it and ordered a 2XL. A little big but leaves room for a layer under the jacket. Only complaint is that the main zipper is SMALL and a bit difficult to start. That said, nice light jacket and was comfy in 42 degree fall weather."
8397296,17747284,"My item came relatively quickly. The quality is very nice and packs down nicely. Although, I haven't had it out below about 45 degrees F it feels like it will be pretty warm. I'm very happy with this product."
8397296,17715604,"Coat is very well made. Has elastic cuffs recessed in each sleeve. While the hood has an elastic band to keep it snug around your face, it doesn't have a cord to pull it in tightly. It cannot be beat for the price."
8397296,17714820,GG
8397296,17709159,"The jacket is sold as a -5¬∞C, but it is not. I wore it in 10¬∞ temp, i still felt very cold infact i was shivering.    I don't think this should cost 4000‚Çπ. Few years back i purchase a jacket from Decathlon for 1500‚Çπ and that is 100 times better than this.    If you live somewhere where the minimum temperature falls around 15¬∞ then maybe go for it. But if it is below that this jacket is useless."
8397296,17705932,Good quality
8397296,17682402,Stuff of the jacket is very light as pur the rate
8397296,17662567,"I picked up a couple of down jackets at the end of a winter sale period and for somewhere around $75 they're great value. Not as well made as the more expensive manufacturers (Nth Face, Patagonia, Salomon, Kathmandu etc) that you might normally buy in Oz but lighter and probably more packable because of that. Haven't worn it in properly cold conditions but handles anything Melbourne can throw at you with just a t-shirt underneath.  I'm 5'9 and 70kg and medium size is perfect for me, could fit base layer or thin jumper underneath if needed to. I would often fit a small in other makes so might be worth going 1 size up from normal depending on what you wanted to fit underneath.  If you want a water resistant jacket that will last you for years in tough conditions in the outdoors look elsewhere but if it's mostly going to be worn in the burbs just to keep you warm on colder days it's great value for money!"
8397296,17652890,Product is a amazing
8397296,17650383,"Sizing chart is right on‚Ä¶very comfortable, warm and priced so much lower than the big name down coats."
8397296,17520644,I bought this product for my Leh trip and I can happily say that it was worth as cold winds were not able to pass through it even when riding bike . Excellent product.
8397296,17502398,Absolute best down puffer packable jacket available for the money. Love this jacket and it will be my go to backpacking jacket from now on.
8397296,17357953,I am totally disappointed; why am purchase it only the name of Decathlon because Decathlon is world quality products so i bought that product but i used first time that jacket; some feather came outside of that jacket. I think 2nd or 3rd time if i use that all feather come outside! I loosed my trust in Decathlon!
8397296,17310387,"I practically lived in this jacket albiet in a different colour during lockdown in 2020. Loved it so much I decided to get another colour. I have a similar jacket from a more expensive brnad that cost x4 times more. The fit, look and warmth of this jacket makes it an easy choice."
8397296,17279897,"Took the jacket on a multi-day backpacking trip in the Uinta mountains in Utah. Temps were high 30s at night. As long as I was moving around I was super warm. If I was stationary for too long the jacket seemed to not do as well. Having some wool layers underneath certainly helped. Also, I'm a decently big guy - usually wear an XL - XXL shirt sizes. Bought the 3XL and the fit was perfect. Overall, terrific jacket for the price and heat to weight ratio. Glad I bought it."
8397296,17249292,"First down jacket I've bought and didn't want to splash +¬£90 on one, this for ¬£50 is great value and really does the job. Great layer for when the sun goes down or reaching a windy summit, slept in mine wild camping when it was cold at night. The hood is really good too as not many come with one! Packs away pretty small and lightweight, can't fault it!"
8397296,17206444,very happy with the quality.. yet to test under the -5C conditions..hopefully it copes well
8397296,17175578,Excellent value for money. Ideal for cool weather.
8397296,17177708,My second DC jacket! Loved it. Amazing!
8397296,17117318,Light weight fine quality and simply superb ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
8397296,17115375,Bought to keep me warm whilst wild camping. Warm with hood and folds down into left pocket.
8397296,17081603,The jacket is great but definalely not meant for -5*C. I was shivering even with a fleece lining inside at 4*C. I wouls still recommend the product but I hope that decathlon corrects the technical specks about the product.
8397296,16825724,"Great value jacket, good workmanship, just enough down to keep warm to about zero with thermals. Light weight for hiking. It‚Äôs not a supa puffy jacket. Good for minimalist."
8397296,16824842,"√Åo nh·∫π, b·ªÅn, m·∫∑c m√πa ƒë√¥ng c·ª±c ·∫•m"
8397296,16767119,It's really good at keeping me warm and packs down small but I am a little concerned at how long it will last on rough walks
8397296,16584210,"This is extremely warm for its light weight, but every time I wear this for more than a couple of days, I end up with shoulder pain. No, the garment isn't too small. I got the Large and I usually wear a Medium. I've washed this once after about a week's wear. After it had been washed, the shoulder pain problem was reduced a bit but not eliminated. I'm wondering how many times I'll need to wash it before this problem goes away. There must be some chemical in the garment that I'm reacting to."
8397296,16566065,"Just as good as jackets costing $300, at only a slight weight penalty of a couple of ounces‚Ä¶  It‚Äôs a no-brainer!"
8397296,16555788,Bought this jacket to wear while paragliding...lighter and warmer than the Patagonia jacket it replaced. Very happy with the purchase.
8397296,16388431,"Been looking for an affordable ""puffy"" and got this on a 'Dan Becker' recommendation. Unfortunately, the temps out here are in the high 90's to low 100's right now and I won't be able to have a real test for a few months.  However, overall quality and materials appear to be excellent!  Be sure to check the sizing chart. I'm normally an XL and this is a 2XL. Fits great!"
8397296,16310612,Jacket is quite short for a medium. Had to reorder a Large
8397296,16273431,"Design, comfort, style, value and fit are excellant. I normally wear large size but ordered xl due to product availability. The xl size will work well. The shell materials and down are quality. My only issue is the front zipper is very difficult to get started, but once started it works fine. Pocket zippers work well. I'll keep this jacket and deal with this minor anoince."
8397296,16219277,Very good brand
8397296,16158903,Very happy with my down jacket
8397296,15873786,Great value lightweight down jacked easily packed in day bag without the hassle of extra weight.
8397296,15765594,These are so highly recommended on review sites and YouTube. Great for the outdoors and a must for any body heading out outdoors.     Super toasty and warm and great quality.
8397296,15604761,"Seeing this recommended as an alternative to other brands' more expensive lightweight downs I picked it up before a spring backpacking trip. It sure was a lot warmer than my years-old synthetic jacket which has lost its puff. It survived packing down and re-lofting several times, and I think having a down hood really ups the warmth. Just this jacket and a thin baselayer kept me pretty comfortable around 50 degrees at night, when I needed at least an extra layer with my old synthetic jacket.    I would say I was on the edge between small and medium via the size chart, but everyone including Decathlon insists the sizing is ultra small, so I went with medium. Well, I had to cinch it down all the way at the waist to keep in the warmth. It might still be the right size to fit layers underneath, but as a trim guy who often buys XS sizes from American retailers, I probably could've gotten a small and been just fine with a bit of a better fit."
8397296,15552796,Great product at a low price.
8397296,15532251,Very excellent
8397296,15513628,"Love this down jacket. warm, fit, and comfortable. very good value for money. stand out among others. very happy purchase."
8397296,15465761,Comfortable & packable & warm puffy for bargain price. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù 175 and ordered x-large which is comfortable & roomy for under layers. These products run small so size up your order.
8397296,15456368,Very nice quality
8397296,15441929,ok
8397296,15296708,"I managed to get a Mountain Hardware Phantom hoodie for $125 because I thought I had to have one due to all the product reviews. In general, it just another jacket that isn‚Äôt amazing and not sure how in the world it‚Äôs worth $350 considering my new Forclaz Trek 100 weighs nearly same, feels sturdier, has all the same features and, more importantly, I would assert that the Forclaz is warmer.     For the price and, given the quality construction, there is no reason person shouldn‚Äôt buy one of these (or more). This is my new spring/summer backpacking as well as tool around town go-to jacket."
8397296,15046250,The warmth is okay. Decathlon team should have a pure black colour option for all of the clothes. They are really bad in terms of colour choices.
8397296,15038670,"Warm, comfortable and light weight."
8397296,14908474,It‚Äôs not very warm was advertised as a down coat but feel like there must be 20 feathers in it very disappointed
8397296,14888017,"Great value for money, packs down small and keeps me warm when stopped. What's not to like?"
8397296,14871679,"I wore this whilst out in the snow, kept me very warm, realised after a week that it packs away into its own pocket.   Great value."
8397296,14835608,"Very comfortable, light weight.am loving it"
8397296,14795163,I nearly love this coat. I walk the dog with only a t-shirt underneath and I am still nice and warm. Like most other four star reviews I just want an elasticated cord on the hood to pull it tight and stop the draughts from hurling round my head. A cheeky chest pocket would be amazing as well. Would pay ¬£50 for it then and would never choose another jacket again.
8397296,14770965,"I really like this product- such a great fit, high quality product and can go under a waterproof layer for colder/ wetter weather"
8397296,14765346,This product is same as looks in picture. Best for low temperature and very light in weight. Anyone can buy it without any quiry.
8397296,14728292,If I could give this 6 stars out of 5 I would. The value here is off the charts. I challenge anyone to find an 800 to 850 fill down Jacket that is even within 100 dollars of this one. It's impossible to find another jacket with these specs for under 200 let alone 100. Aside from the specs this thing is the most comfortable jacket I have ever owned. It's the only hacker I have ever owned that doesn't feel restrictive around my shoulders/bust but yet doesnt look baggy. It literally feels like you arent wearing anything but yet you are warm. It's a strange feeling because of how light it is. This jacket even went on sale at one point for 50 bucks so I bought 2 more. Haha! Dont understand how this high of fill power can be sold at this price. Have never discovered a product that is this good of a value compared to the competition.
8397296,14656833,Very comfortable product
8397296,14655918,Light weight jacket   I have never seen this before  There is no need to wear more warmers while wear this jacket
8397296,14646761,Light and effective in keeping cold away.nice feel on the body
8397296,14615462,GOOD PRODUCT
8397296,14575714,"So let me preface this by saying that I love this jacket. However, the sizing is a bit confusing. I originally ordered a men‚Äôs large. When I received it the outer paper tag said US L/ EU XL but the inner fabric tag said US M/ EU L. I tend to believe the inner tag because I fit into US large clothing whether it is slim fit or not. I ordered an XL and it fit perfect. So I would say if you are buying from the US you should order a size up what you would normally order. Decathalon should probably fix this in the future though because it‚Äôs a bit confusing that the 2 tags say different sizes"
8397296,14555015,This jacket is warm and beautiful.
8397296,14506589,Got this to wear under my wading jacket and am very happy with it also a great price.
8397296,14505048,"Tried this jacket in snowfall and icy area, kept me alive."
8397296,14484522,Nice inexpensive hiking camp jacket. I would order it again.
8397296,14440232,"Product also good and good service, but billing processing is poor so please increase your billing counters."
8397296,14419402,Fantastic product
8397296,14419387,It is a warm jacket but packing is coming out.Either product is defective or stitching threads are weak.
8397296,14325617,Its not warm enough in 1¬∞
8397296,14321484,No comment. I am speckles
8397296,14309109,This has to be the warmest lightweight jacket I have ever owned. The heat retention and warmth are fantastic- great for everyday use and can be stowed away easily.
8397296,14290080,Very warm in snow and freezing winds.
8397296,14280310,Awesome product
8397296,14269158,Five stars because it rocks all the boxes.  Very good at regulating heat. The stats are correct in that it will keep you warm in a -5 wind chill. It will also keep you comfortable on a 5 degree temperature.  VERY light weight - my reason for buying.  Personally I bought it for wildcamping but have been wearing it non stop because it's so versatile.    Highly recommended
8397296,14248849,Light and warm . highly recommend
8397296,14245643,Nice warm and cosy jacket. Save a lot of space.

8397296,14241468,"Jacket is decent enough to keep you warm.. however, I didn‚Äôt get the cover shown in the images. It was one of the reason I purchased this jacket but sadly didn‚Äôt get it."
8397296,14234179,Light weight and useful...I am wearing it most of the time
8397296,14200194,"It's very light weight. But, it does not keep you warm even at 8 deg. I don't think it can be used at -5 deg."
8397296,14186946,Great
8397296,14164960,"Bad product, i only used it for once an  d the feathers are releasing from the stretched area"
8397296,14164003,It's one of the best product. Me and my girl both are using it from last 2 years. Waiting for the prices to go more down to add more :)
8397296,14162815,Very comfortable and light weight
8397296,14073653,Love it
8397296,14058563,"For the price this is an excellent jacket, very warm and lightweight"
8397296,14021056,"Sizing is a bit smaller than previous Decathlon down jackets, I have a Quechua Xlight which is size S but in this jacket had to take the M as it was too tight so definately size up or be disappointed! Other than that we'll put together and nice fit. I have the lighter blue version and it looks great."
8397296,13981362,"I am totally amazed after buying this jacket, it's been one year I am using it and haven't found any complaint till now..it can easily servive 5 degrees without mid layer     Best value for money product. Hats off Decathlon for such a wonderful product."
8397296,13962326,Good buy at great price. And keeps warmer than envisaged.  Only problem is the space in the hood (between the chin and hood bottom) is much and let's cold air in.
8397296,13900269,Very good quality according to the price. No any one brand like it
8397296,13882756,Bad
8397296,13871453,Though I haven't use these (for treak) product due to pandamic situation but from my overall observation I think these products will be good for trekking in future.
8397296,13846866,Packs up to a small ball inside its own pocket. Perfect as emergency warmth in the bottom of a pack
8397296,13816204,Excellent
8397296,13792905,Very thin
8397296,13781242,Poor quality
8397296,13762707,"Great quality jacket, warm, good fit and packs down to nothing at a great price."
8397296,13743857,"For the price its amazing, no loose feathers good baffles, and showerproof"
8397296,13704725,I've had this jacket for three years now and it's never let me down. It compresses down small into my rucksack for wild camps and hikes all year round. It's surprisingly warm and cosy too. I've made a full video review of this jacket here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o452jeoTiIs&t=22s
8397296,13691985,Vrey warm but very light weight. Perfect fit for me. My chest is 103 cm. and belly is 109 cm. I choose L size. Earlier I ordered M size. But that was little bit short for my body.
8397296,13534836,"Excellent jacket. Packs down very small yet warm enough to keep you safe and comfortable when the temperatures drop. Have had mine now for 3 years and worn it in a variety of situations including camping and hiking and around town and is still in great shape. From what I've seen there's really nothing else out there that comes close in terms of quality and value for money.    A draw string around the hood and waist would be a nice addition, but not a big issue."
8397296,13344570,like the jacket it's so warm and light
8397296,12727632,Good quality and value for money
8397296,12320621,"I originally had to return the first jacket I ordered because of poor down filling in both sleeves. There wasn't enough down filling or the down had already prior to purchasing migrated to one side of the baffles so it left cold spots on both sleeves. It was a pretty easy return process, I'm just still waiting for the full refund. Shipping was fast too.    The new one which doesn't have as bad as a problem with the fill (after throwing it in the dryer on low heat with some dryer balls, it really puffed up) but then I noticed there was some bad stitching near the main zipper of the new jacket. If you are looking for a cheaper jacket then this maybe the one for you, it actually keeps you warm but make sure to inspect your jacket fully before committing. You maybe sacrificing some quality for the low price."
8397296,12159331,"I can hardly believe the value for money of this jacket. It is, in my opinion, the best item in all of Decathlon's range (and I love a lot of Decathlon stuff).     -It's unbelievably light and packable. My size L is 292g. Most down jackets this light are in the ¬£200-¬£400 range... this is ¬£40.  -It's very well-built, warm, and comfortable. Not very trendy but what mountain gear is, haha.  -It has everything you need, and nothing you don't. I would recommend this jacket to absolutely anyone who goes hiking or backpacking. This jacket blows all the competition out of the water. And unlike comparably cheap jackets you might get from China, the down is certified (and of premium 800+FP!)    The only remotely negative things:  -I would like an inside pocket  -As is well-documented, the sizing is small. I'm usually an M, and size L fits me perfectly. Really nice cut.    Do yourself a favour and buy this jacket. I think anyone who tries it will never pay hundreds for the more premium brands again. There's simply no need, this is just as good, if not better. You can get 3-5 of these jackets for the price of one Patagonia... go figure!"
8397296,11801329,"While purchasing this product sales man told me that we can withstand upto -5 degrees with this jacket, now i can‚Äôt go outside even temperature 10 degree, I‚Äôm very unsatisfied with this product"
8397296,11783892,I have bought this with anticipation that this will atleast survive in -2 degree but surprisingly it couldn't survived in 1 degree as well  Very bad experience that u have bought another jacket from Moscow
8397296,11681258,Fantastic product love it. Delivery on time.
8397296,11401970,"The jacket looks good. The quality could‚Äôve been better, All the threads and feather like particles started to come out just next day. This jacket keeps you very warm and it is water repellent."
8397296,11374399,I like 2 things about this jacket beside that the pricing is very reasonable.  1: Its very warm   2: It is so light to wear and also to carry in your bag.
8397296,11267259,Some sort of cotton pieces comes out automatically From fine holes of jacket...     I think it is damage but lost revisits so can‚Äôt exchange
8397296,11262048,"I had ordered this product on 04.01.2020 and the product was home delivered by Decathlon on 05.01.2020 i.e. within 24 hours of the placement of the order. That's appreciable speed! The jacket is very lightweight and very warm. I have used it on only two layers i.e. inner and shirt and the warmth is excellent. Even while riding motorcycle, I did not, even for a second, felt cold or windy. Worth the price! Thank you Decathlon!!"
8397296,10859067,I love this jacket  Not only is it Inexpensive but is also extremely warm I had the chance to take the jacket with me when I went camping the high temperature of the day was 32Ôæü and the low was only 9 with the right layers underneath the jacket I was kept toasty warm    Compare the price of this jacket to that of the mountain hardware ghost whisperer. For the same money you can but several of these jackets to only 1 of the Mountain Hardware jackets.  I only wish there was a way to cinch the hood a little tighter other than this jacket is fantastic
8397296,10806240,Having read the previous reviews I decided to go with the XL rather than L and was glad I did as the fit is slightly small. Worn for the first time today and was remarkably warm giving it‚Äôs lightweight.
8397296,10800035,"I have purchase blue winter jacket 3999‚Çπ this is very nice product,as same i want like this for my wife"
8397296,10766340,"Methinks, it's the best jacket I have ever purchased.  Used it on a hike in the Himalayas to Pindari glacier. 6 days of hiking. Maximum altitude gain was 12,000 feet. Time: mid November.  I did not feel cold. Paired with a (Decathlon) Merino wool t-shirt and base layer.   The jacket fits very well, quite light weight, and very warm for its weight.  Quite satisfied with this purchase."
8397296,10559416,Tested in Iceland on weeks photography expedition from dawn to dusk plus in the middle of the night photographing the Northern lights. Warn as a third layer over thermal top and fleece with outer shell it proved amazingly warm. The hat very useful addition and can be warn over a woolly hat (I often needed 3 hats including shell!). Easy to strip off and stuff in rucksack as you exercise and warm up. Very light. Water repellant but advice popping on shell ASAP if it rains. Fantastic piece of kit well made. Stood up to the punishment well. If you believe in layering then this is your third layer.
8397296,10430029,"At the price - compared with other brands - I didn't hold out great expectations for this product. But I was sooo wrong.  I couldn't be happier.  With regards to sizing, I measured myself and came out on the sizing guide as a medium, but based on the reviews, I took a gamble and went for the large - Glad I did.  I'm 6ft and 80kg's and it fits perfectly.  Can't say enough good things about this jacket =)"
8397296,10391005,...
8397296,10209168,A warm lightweight jacket at a great price.very pleased as I am with all decathlon purchase's
8397296,9701388,"A snug fitted jacket . So light weight. Looks cool  Wind proof . I Haven't worn in the rain yet   I don't get over heated driving in it.   After 2 weeks use, there doesn't appear to be many faults. Apart from not having an inside pocket.   I like the fact that it folds down into the left pocket."
8397296,8497502,"This jacket offers great value for a pocketable mid-layer down at a very affordable price. I have only owned it for a short time but it is warm, light, and comfortable. A few improvements could be to add an adjustment cord for the hood and also to add one or two inside pockets to store more stuff. Can't really complain at this price!"
8397296,8274316,"This is a fantastic jacket at an excellent price. Predominantly purchased in bulk as a warm layer for a Nordic ski team - where it excelled in -20 within the Arctic Circle, it is equally well suited to urban environments in spring. Fairly water resistant and totally wind proof. A fantastic piece of kit."
8397296,8137182,I am a large in every jacket I have bought in the past 5 years.  Bought this jacket and couldn‚Äôt even do the zip up comfortably.  These are tiny - if you order go at least a size bigger!  Product itself is good - but bought online and had to visit a store to change it.
8397296,7978383,"Buy this jacket !!!!!!!!  I own a rab jacket , which is brilliant, expensive!!!   However this jacket would be a very worthy replacement!  Would not think twice , 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
8397296,7878862,"800 cuin, packable, YKK zippers, warm, what else can I ask from a 40¬£ dawn jacket?"

8397296,7386447,I‚Äôve owned this down jacket for over a year now. It‚Äôs so lightweight and really warm. I have an expensive ¬£100 one but I find I am always reaching for this jacket as it is comfortable and so smooth. Used it wild camping and on cold long walks. I can‚Äôt fault it amazing value for money highly recommended
8397296,7136447,Happy customer
8397296,7076432,"light ,warm and easy to pack plus good value for money ."
8397296,6979526,"Well constructed, very warm and light too. Bought as a stop gap but the more expensive jacket is off the shopping list as this jacket is awesome. Cannot actually fault it. I'm 5'11"" and 80kg and medium is perfect for me as a mid layer. If I was looking to wear layers under it I would size up to a large. Depends how fitted you want it."
8397296,5331619,"Very warm, good insulation. Jacket sixe XXL good fit with good sleeve cuff length. Very pleased with product."

8397296,5186234,"Use it for skiing as a warm top 2nd layer under the shell jacket. Excellent. Replaced my two other 2nd layer tops for being lightweight, soft and breathable. After skiing in it for 10 days in January , bought another one to keep in reserve. At this price??"
8397296,4997077,"Great jacket, I use it everyday its super light and very warm. Excellent pricing makes it a no brainer."
